# Cseq-Simulator
Cseq-Simulator is a pipeline for realistic RNA-Clip simulations. It mimics key steps of Clip protocols and allows with user provided profiles to simulate any diagnostic event distribution (RBPs). Furthermore, Cseq-Simulator is very individual and lets the user provide a list of RBP binding sites or transcipt abundance profiles.
